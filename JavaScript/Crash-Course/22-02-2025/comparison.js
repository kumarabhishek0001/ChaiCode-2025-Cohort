// comparison -> output of comparison is either true or false
const x = 5;

//* checks equality
//console.log(x === y) //this is strict checking compares datatype also
//console.log( 24 == '24') //this gives output as true since data types are not checked


//*checks non-equality
// console.log(24 != '24') //-> this ruturns true do strict checking
// console.log(24 !== '24') //-> this also does type checking


//* greater than or less than
